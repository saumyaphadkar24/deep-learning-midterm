Do not provide additional information or explanation in your response.\\n\\n### Math Question:\\nPaul needed to buy some new clothes for work.  He had a 10% off coupon that he could use on his entire purchase after any other discounts.  Paul bought 4 dress shirts at $15.00 apiece, 2 pairs of pants that each cost $40.00.  He found a suit for $150.00 and 2 sweaters for $30.00 each.  When he got to the register, the clerk told him that the store was offering 20% off of everything in the store.  After the discounts and the coupon, how much did Paul spend on his new clothes?\\n\\n### Provided Answer:\\n252\\n\\n### Detailed Solution:\\nLet's solve this problem using Python code.\\n<llm-code>\\nshirts_cost = 4 * 15.00\\npants_cost = 2 * 40.00\\nsuit_cost = 150.00\\nsweaters_cost = 2 * 30.00\\ntotal_cost_before_20_discount = shirts_cost + pants_cost + suit_cost + sweaters_cost\\ndiscount_percent = 20\\ndiscount_portion = discount_percent / 100\\ntotal_cost_after_20_discount = total_cost_before_20_discount - total_cost_before_20_discount * discount_portion\\nten_percent_off_coupon_amount = total_cost_after_20_discount * 10 / 100\\ntotal_cost_after_all_discounts = total_cost_after_20_discount - ten_percent_off_coupon_amount\\ntotal_cost_after_all_discounts\\n</llm-code>\\n<llm-code-output>\\n252.0\\n</llm-code-output>\\nThus Paul paid \\\\boxed{252} dollars for all of his clothes.\\n\\nAnswer is correct (True/False only):True<|end_of_text|>\""
